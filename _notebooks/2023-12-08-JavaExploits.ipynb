Going to [vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php), a common test site for web attacks, we can test and see how not securing data can be dangerous. Keep in mind that this is highly illegal to do on public networks.\n",

Websites that mask themselves as other websites usually catch people that don't pay much attention to what they click.
