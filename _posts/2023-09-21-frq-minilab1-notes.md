Code Monkeys

Classes (2022) (0.95)
- creating book class and textbook class extending information
- addition on top of title and price
- running constructor from parents class
- using override to override function
- checking the textbook title and price and edition
- creating and editing textbooks
- super (references parent class)
- @override - marker allows to override a function in java (operates like child function)
- public vs private - private can't be used outside of class that it is defined in
- getters and setters - manages variables with encapsulation

Methods and Control Structures (2022) (0.93)
- given classes and you have to write methods
- nesting statements to check whether pre-requisites are met
- loops nesting if statements to run a piece of code multiple times
- calling methods is needed
- knowing how to program logic (if statements, loops)

ArrayList (2022) (0.92)
- setting private variables that are used in specific class
- .length finds the number of values in the array that is in question
- iteration through data using `i` to go through an entire list

Classes (2015) (0.88)
- differentiating between capitals and length
- class, constructor, methods
- private header
- StringBuilder() - builds strings easier
- get basics done and that will lead to the rest being done
